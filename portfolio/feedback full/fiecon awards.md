He's also recently set up the podcast which speaks for itself really!

# FIECON Funniest
- Everything he does makes me laugh. Extremely funny guy!

# Technical Wizard
- I think Tom has contributed hugely this year to supporting the improvement and bringing of efficiencies into FIECON across multiple workstreams he has contributed to. He also launched a podcast! Fun yet innovative and informative!

- Always comes up with the most surprising yet real timesaving innovations - e.g. automatisation of the change log in models. Tom's creativity and drive to streamline mundane processes is really admirable!

- Tom has worked incredibly hard to produce the Artificially Unintelligent podcast, which has not only entertained but also introduced valuable insights into AI and its role in the workplace. Has also been at the forefront of introducing new AI techniques that have helped streamline processes and make everyone at FIECON more efficient in their day-to-day work. His innovative approach to improving workflows and fostering a greater understanding of AI is truly making a difference.

- Helping to drive AI at FIECON. Pushing ideas, seeking advice on how to improve. Doing this all alongside delivering for clients.

- Made more suggestions to improve our day-to-day than any other person by a mile. He always says yes to help executing them, sometimes even too often.

- Consistently going above and beyond sharing AI knowledge, and skills and building useful tech to assist with project delivery, as well as entertaining us with his AI podcast.

 - Tom's worked on developing loads of tools that make mundane tasks much easier and he's an absolute wizard at it. The Excel add-on for easily tracking changes in the change log is an absolute game changer. He's my go-to person for support in VBA and always amazes me how easily he grasps the code even if he'd never exposed to it before. He's also passionate about communicating all these tech with the company, which is most clearly evident in his idea of the AI podcast.

 - He has been super helpful, innovative and made my start comfortable. I can go to him whenever I need some help and he will spend some time explaining the concept to me.

- He is such a wizard at R and Excel, he's helped us with some technical issues and finds ways to make processes quicker and easier which is so valuable
- My first day in the office involved a demonstration by Tom of what a CEM looked like and did, and from that I knew he was the technical wizard! Tom is clearly very passionate about all things tech and AI and that shows in all of the extra work he has been doing on top of his project work
- The go-to person for any software/coding/modelling problems. Always has a new website or trick to teach you and help you improve.
